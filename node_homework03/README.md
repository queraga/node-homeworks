Node.js Homework 3

Task 1 – Creating and Deleting a Directory

This script demonstrates basic file system operations using Node.js fs module.

What it does:
	•	Creates a directory named myFolder
	•	Handles possible errors
	•	Deletes the directory after successful creation
	•	Logs success or error messages

Concepts used:
	•	fs.mkdir
	•	fs.rmdir
	•	Asynchronous callbacks
	•	Error handling
	•	Execution order control

⸻

Task 2 – Writing and Reading a File

This script demonstrates file creation and reading using asynchronous methods.

What it does:
	•	Creates a file info.txt
	•	Writes the text “Node.js is awesome!”
	•	Reads the file after successful write
	•	Outputs file content to the console
	•	Handles possible errors

Concepts used:
	•	fs.writeFile
	•	fs.readFile
	•	Callback flow
	•	Asynchronous execution
	•	Error handling

⸻

Key Learning Points
	•	Understanding asynchronous behavior in Node.js
	•	Correct execution order using nested callbacks
	•	Proper error handling
	•	Working with the file system module (fs)
